Modification Author: Xavi

Tested OS: Windows 10 (is does not works yet in linux)

Materials:

x1 GBxCart RW: https://www.gbxcart.com/ (you can use any of these webpage versions)
x1 micro usb cable
x1 gb/gbc/gba cartridge (that depends on what GBxCart version are you using)

*ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS SOFTWARE WAS ONLY TESTED IN THE GBxCart RW GB/GBC VERSION 
SO I DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT THIS SOFTWARE COULD BE 100% WORKING WITH A GBxCart RW GBA VERSION*

_______________________HOW DOES IT WORKS_______________________
This program uses the hardware of GBxCart RW 
to automatically detect your cartridge, get the rom inside, get the save inside your cartridge
and run the emulator with the imported game. 
And then the same program automatically uploads your pc save
to the cartridge when closing the emulator.
and YES all this with only executing the autodetectCartridgeAndLoadGameToEmulator.exe.
_______________________HOW DOES IT WORKS_______________________

_______________________HOW TO USE IT_______________________

1. Plug the Game Boy cartridge to your GBxCart RW device
2. Plug the GBxCart RW device to your computer by usb
3. Launch the autodetectCartridgeAndLoadGameToEmulator.exe program
4. Wait until the game opens
5. *That step is more like an advice* when closing the emulator the console program running in the background
   will upload your imported save to the cartridge so if you don't wanna save your progress you can disconnect
   your device from your computer or close the background console program

_______________________HOW TO USE IT_______________________


_______________________TROUBLESHOOTING_______________________
1. my game does not load or the software turns off when reading my cartridge: That happens mainly because your cartridge is not correctly connected so the most common solution is to remove your cartridge from the adapter blow the pins and return to connect it and try again. that could happen alot so you must be insistent.
2. the emulator detects the game name as an extension and it doesn't start: that's a tiny issue with the blank spaces or " ", in this case the game have been correctly imported but you should load it manually by opening the emulator and loading the imported rom.
